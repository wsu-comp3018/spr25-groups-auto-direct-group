autosdirect_modelfile:

This is a file that can be opened in MySQL workbench. It allows the database tables and their relationships to be viewed and amended. When making and sharing changes (probably future development teams), this file is particularly helpful.

autosdirect_sqlscript:

This file is a SQL script. It will need to be executed against your local database instance/connection that you set up. Executing this script will populate the database to the state that the PA2506 project team had at handover.
